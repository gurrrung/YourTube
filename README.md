## Introduction

The truth is YouTube is designed to make anyone binge-watch it all day. We want to make it productive for people who use it for work or learning. This extension is an attempt to provide a minimalist approach to Youtube with full customizability.

## Usage
1) Install the extension
2) Customize the extension using the `Options` menu.

## Installation

Coming Soon

## Development

To run a development server that will watch for file changes and rebuild the scripts, run:

```
npm run watch
```

To just build the files without the development server:

```
npm run build
```

Both commands will create a `dist/` directory, it will contain the built files that should be loaded into the browser or packed.
